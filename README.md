# hotel_revenue_study
Training project on the analysis and visualization of hotel booking statistics


#### Project for building the dashboard using Power BI to present to conditional stakeholders

Also to show answers to questions in a visual report:

- "Is hotel revenue growing by year?"

            There are 2 hotel types and it's better to segment revenue by hotel type
                           
- "Should parking lot size be increased?"

            The point is to understand if there is a trand is guest with personal cars
                           
- "What trends there are in the data?"

            It's need to focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality
